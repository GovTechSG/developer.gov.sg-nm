<!-- Event details -->
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
  Government workloads are typically sensitive and unable to directly use commercial cloud hosting. Over the years, we have journeyed through different implementations of cloud hosting to benefit workloads in a secure and compliant manner. From each implementation, we attained certain successes and have learnt to do better. 
</p>
<p>
  This Meetup would cover key insights on the Government’s various implementations of cloud hosting including our next bound – implementing Government on Commercial Cloud + (GCC+). Agencies can learn how to gear for success on GCC+ and understand latest Cloud Service Provider (CSP) controls, such as the AWS Nitro System, to better secure their cloud journeys.
</p> 
<p>
  <b>Who should attend:</b> Tech professionals interested in the Government's cloud hosting journey; Levelling: Intermediate
