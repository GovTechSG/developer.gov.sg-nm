“Anyhow Code Also Secure”(ACAS) was jointly developed by GovTech’s [Cyber Security Group (CSG)](https://www.tech.gov.sg/cyber-security-group){:target="_blank"} and A*STAR’s Institute for Infocomm Research to eliminate the undesirable effects of insecure code through a secure-by-default framework. ACAS brings web application security to the next level by removing or limiting insecure behavior in the application. Hence, the impact of vulnerabilities is reduced or removed, even when developers write insecure code by accident.

Many of the vulnerabilities that ACAS addresses are high-risk in nature, found in the OWASP Top-10, and have been around for over 20 years. These include “Cross-site Scripting” (XSS), “OS command injection”, and “Indirect Object References (IDOR)”.

ACAS uses [Django](https://djangoproject.com){:target="_blank"}, a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development. Built and maintained by experienced developers, Django handles many web application development hassles, so developers can focus on writing apps without reinventing the wheel.

### How It Works

ACAS comprises several independent Django modules that alter Django’s behavior to close security gaps. Each module safeguards the application from a specific category of vulnerability, with minimal configuration or modification to the application.

Developers can incorporate ACAS modules in their existing Django web applications or build a fresh Django web application with ACAS starter kits.

### Key Benefits

- Enhances security of web applications
- Increases speed of application development
- Enables developers to focus on coding functional behavior for the application, instead of reimplementing or incorporating security controls in an insecure way

### Pricing

ACAS is free and can be used for any Singapore Government projects.
