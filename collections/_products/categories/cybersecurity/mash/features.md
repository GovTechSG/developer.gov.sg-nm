### Platform-agnostic accessibility
MASH is platform-agnostic and accessible via API endpoints.

### Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CI/CD) integration
The MASH “submission” API can be integrated into the [SHIP-HATS](/products/categories/devops/ship-hats/overview){:target="_blank"} pipeline without blocking the build workflow. Upon completion of the scan, the analysis reports will be available in JSON and Excel formats, and can be retrieved via the “result” API endpoint.

### Leverages industry standards
MASH references the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) [Mobile AppSec Verification Standard](https://mas.owasp.org/MASVS/){:target="_blank"} (MASVS), and the [Mobile Security Testing Guide](https://mas.owasp.org/MASTG/){:target="_blank"} (MASTG) for its implementation.
