### Before you onboard the OpenAttestation Wallet App

Before adopting the OpenAttestation Wallet App, agencies should have the means to issue OpenAttestation (OA) documents. This can be achieved in two ways:

1. Deploying an on-premise implementation of the OA Framework.
2. Government agencies can onboard onto OA as a Service. 

### To Create your own version of the OpenAttestation Wallet App:

1.  Download the source code:
    - [Android](https://github.com/Open-Attestation/oa-wallet-android){:target="\_blank"}
    - [iOS](https://github.com/Open-Attestation/oa-wallet-ios){:target="\_blank"}

2. Follow the setup instructions found on the respective repositories.
3. Customise the mobile app’s design and features according to your organisation’s needs.
4. Deploy the mobile app to your users, either through the respective app stores or by distributing the app directly to users.

### To integrate OpenAttestation Mobile libraries into your existing app to view and verify OpenAttestation documents:

1. Visit the GitHub repositories for the OpenAttestation Mobile libraries:
   - [Android](https://github.com/Open-Attestation/open-attestation-android){:target="\_blank"}
   - [iOS](https://github.com/Open-Attestation/open-attestation-ios){:target="\_blank"}

2. Follow the instructions in the installation section to include the respective libraries in your mobile app’s project.
3. Use the APIs according to your business needs.
