Sign with Singpass allows Singapore residents to use the Singpass app to digitally sign an electronic document. This is a secure electronic signature that is uniquely linked to the signer. Signatures made using Sign with Singpass are regarded as secure electronic signatures under Singapore's Electronic Transactions Act.

The user journey for Sign with Singpass is similar to logging in with [Singpass](/products/categories/digital-identity/singpass/){:target="\_blank"}, Singapore’s National Digital Identity (NDI) – users can simply scan the QR code displayed on the screen using their Singpass app, and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the authentication and signing process.

The signed document is platform-agnostic, allowing the validated signature to be viewed with the user’s preferred system.

To date, more than 500,000 signatures have been made using Sign with Singpass in various use cases piloted by companies in industries including insurance, real estate and banking.

Sign with Singpass is part of the [Singapore Government Tech Stack](/singapore-government-tech-stack/){:target="\_blank"}.
