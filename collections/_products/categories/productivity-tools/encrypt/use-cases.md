### Helping public officers to anonymise data efficiently and securely

Data sharing is essential to unlocking the potential of technology for the public good.

WOG data practitioners may face technical challenges implementing the the [Instruction Manual for ICT&SS Management](/guidelines/standards-and-best-practices/instruction-manual-for-ict-ss-management.html){:target="_blank"} guidelines and other data de-identification policies.

These challenges may include:

- Difficulty in interpreting the guidelines
- Unfamiliarity or lack of access to proper technical tools, and
- Uncertainty over whether the implementation is up to standard

enCRYPT will help public officers to anonymise data quickly and with confidence, in compliance with the public sector guidelines. This results in time and cost savings, and better performance.
