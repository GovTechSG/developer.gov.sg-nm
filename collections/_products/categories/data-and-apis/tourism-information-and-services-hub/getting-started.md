### Connecting to Tourism Information and Services Hub (TIH) via APIs

Businesses can connect with TIH via an API. To gain access to TIH’s APIs, start by following the instructions [here](https://tih-dev.stb.gov.sg/getting-started){:target="_blank"}. This allows direct integration with TIH and business offerings will be reflected automatically in TIH. 

### Connecting manually to TIH

Alternatively, businesses can also manually connect with TIH without API integration.

1. To register for TIH access, click [here](https://tih.stb.gov.sg/content/tih/en/profile/register.html){:target="_blank"}.
2. Click on this [link](https://tih.stb.gov.sg/content/tih/en/about_tih/help-centre/start-tih/register-account.html){:target="_blank"} to view the video on registering for a TIH account.
