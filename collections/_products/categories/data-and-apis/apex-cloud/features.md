### An API manager for effective management of API life cycles

The API Manager is the core of the APEX Cloud API management solution. It is a self-service admin console that allows API publishers to manage the life cycle of their APIs, from registration to retirement of APIs. It also allows API consumers to discover and subscribe to APIs, as well as manage their application credentials. The settings configured through the API manager are then applied to the API gateway.

### An API gateway for security and connectivity between APIs and consumers

The API gateway is the core infrastructure that provides security and connectivity between APIs and its consumers. It is the “front-door” that sits between the clients and the backend services that it provides security for. It takes API calls from clients and routes them to the correct backend services.

### An API builder for integration and orchestration with service providers

The API Builder is an open-source, Node.js software that acts as an integration and orchestration layer between APEX Cloud and any existing service providers. It comes with a low/no code approach and rich set of ready-to-use libraries that allows users to develop integration use cases much faster than when implementing them manually.
