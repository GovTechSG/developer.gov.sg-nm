The onboarding process for an agency’s VICA chatbot is as follows:

1. To begin a VICA project, a Project Commissioning Memorandum will first be signed between the requesting agency and the VICA team.
2. The team will undertake to understand the agency’s requirements and determine whether VICA can fulfil the agency’s needs.
3. If the project is allowed to proceed, the agency will have to fill an onboarding form. This will provide the VICA team with the relevant information to create the corresponding chatbot environment and relevant admin accounts.
4. The project kick-off session commences.
5. The VICA team will schedule regular project check-in sessions with the agency, to discuss project status updates and answer any queries from content owners, for example.
6. The VICA team will also conduct a training session for agency users. The training will cover areas such as NLP basics, using the VICA Admin Console and Google DialogFlow.
7. The agency will proceed to create content for the chatbot.
8. The VICA team will perform Quality Assurance (QA) by going through the intentions, training phrases and responses of the chatbot. The agency will need to address any issues reported during the QA process, before the chatbot can be launched.
9.  The chatbot can go live after the QA process has been completed.

After the chatbot goes live, agencies can use the VICA support portal to log tickets when they encounter issues. Agencies will also receive any subsequent chatbot enhancements released by the VICA team.
