### Platform-agnostic engine

VICA is platform agnostic and allows the use of different kinds of technologies, like NLP and large language model (LLM) algorithms such as ChatGPT.  VICA thus offers greater compatibility with new and evolving technologies for developing better chatbots.

### Automated importing of datasets

VICA automates the process of importing datasets. You can also compile multiple datasets and import them together.

### Unified chat frontend for common branding across WOG

The VICA widget provides a united frontend, so agencies just need to provide an avatar to activate the widget. Agencies can save on the resources required to create their own frontend for the chatbot.

### Singpass integration

VICA offers integration with [Singpass](/products/categories/digital-identity/singpass/){:target="\_blank"}, so agencies can transact with Singpass and [Corppass](/products/categories/digital-identity/corppass/){:target="\_blank"} users directly through the chatbot, if necessary. One example is the ACRA chatbot.

### Live chat escalation

VICA allows agencies to specify situations in which cases are escalated from the chatbots to human agents. This allows citizens to switch from a VICA chatbot and continue the conversation with a human agent, when necessary.

### Support for multiple chat platforms

VICA offers popular chat platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram as channels for the agenciesâ€™ chatbots to engage with end users.
