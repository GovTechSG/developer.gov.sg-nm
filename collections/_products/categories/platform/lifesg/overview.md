For example, registrations for all eligible births in Singapore must be done online through LifeSG since 29 May 2022. New parents can perform the birth registration, open a Child Development Account with banks and apply for the Baby Bonus scheme in 15 minutes on the LifeSG app or website. This used to be a 60-minute process involving different agency touchpoints.

LifeSG was initially launched as Moments of Life (MOL), which was aimed at serving parents with young children. In August 2020, MOL was rebranded as LifeSG with a vision to serve all users during various key stages of their lives. As of July 2022, LifeSG has had more than 1.2 million app downloads.

The LifeSG team is working with partner agencies to onboard more services and guides that help users navigate government services and to improve the user experience on the app and web.

### Success Stories

- With LifeSG, Chien Koh Wei, a second-time dad, was able to swiftly register the birth of his second child and save himself a trip to the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA). The app enabled Koh Wei to complete the birth registration process as well as apply for his child’s Baby Bonus without leaving his wife’s side after birth. When the time comes for Koh Wei to plan for his children’s future, he can also easily search and narrow down childcare centres and preschools with LifeSG.

- Apart from new parents, LifeSG has also helped Cheryl Choo, an enthusiastic volunteer who frequently assists senior citizens. Cheryl shared that LifeSG is one of the best ways for senior citizens to check on government policies or schemes that apply to them. She teaches the elderly to search for ongoing active ageing programmes and join community networks using the LifeSG app, enabling them to maintain an active social life. Aside from her volunteer work, Cheryl also uses LifeSG to check on her HDB grants and loan eligibility when she makes financial plans for her new home with her fiancé.
