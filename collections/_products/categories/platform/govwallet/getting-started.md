### For citizens and residents

GovWallet can be accessed using official government apps, such as LifeSG, Healthy 365 or Singpass mobile.  If you are a beneficiary of the government pay-outs, you can download these apps through the Apple App Store (for iOS) or the Google Play store (for Android).

At a merchant store or stall, use the LifeSG and Healthy 365 apps to scan the SGQR, NETS or PayNow QR codes to pay them.

### For public agencies 

Follow these steps to onboard GovWallet:

1. Issue a purchase order to the banking partner of your choice from the relevant WoG bulk tender.
2. Identify the frontend interface, i.e. the mobile app that your end users or beneficiaries will be using to receive and spend the pay-outs.
3. Contact the GovWallet team through this [form](https://form.gov.sg/62280856ba91100012050933){:target="_blank"}, to complete the onboarding process for your agency with the mobile app of your choice.

Note that the onboarding timeline varies from agency to agency, depending on the integration with the mobile app of choice and the GovWallet connectivity setup.

The GovWallet team is currently working on a self-service admin portal for agencies to administer their schemes without the need to set up connectivity to the GovWallet system.
