### Control of where pay-outs can be spent

GovWallet enables agencies to select specific merchants and control where pay-outs can be used. Agencies can specify the list of merchants that qualify for each scheme.

### Control of pay-outs validity period 

GovWallet enables agencies to specify the period the payouts can be spent before it expires.

### Integration with various frontend interfaces

As a backend service module, GovWallet can be easily integrated with existing government mobile apps, such as [LifeSG](/products/categories/platform/lifesg/overview){:target="_blank"}, [Singpass](/products/categories/digital-identity/singpass/overview){:target="_blank"}, and [Healthy 365](https://hpb.gov.sg/healthy-living/healthy-365){:target="_blank"} (Health Promotion Board). It can also be integrated with websites and ATMs.

### Supports PayNow and NETS payment 

GovWallet supports payments on both PayNow and NETS payment platforms, as most merchants can accept either of these platforms. Agencies can select the payment platform to be enabled for their disbursement schemes.

###  Supports GovCash (withdrawal of pay-outs in cash via ATMs)

GovCash is a new payment mode that allows eligible citizens to withdraw their government payouts – such as GST Vouchers – in cash from the OCBC network of ATMs across Singapore that have been integrated with GovWallet. Users do not need to have an OCBC bank account to use GovCash. Citizens without banking accounts also spend their GovCash payouts via the LifeSG app, thanks to the GovWallet integration.
