When fully developed, SAM+ will offer more than 90 features grouped into five service pillars:

### Search and discovery
Search existing sensors deployed and data captured using various search methods – such as by drawing an area of interest, by asset name or asset owner – for the ease of sensor planning. The data is indexed and categorised for easy search. 

### Data aggregation
SAM+ ingests data from multiple sources and aggregates them into a single platform to allow sensor planners to select on their area of interest or data for their planning purposes, from the variety of data available.

### Visualisation and analytics
Users can enjoy a visualisation of all their sensors and the data captured via a dashboard, allowing a greater oversight of their assets. This also allows users to leverage in-built analytics tools (e.g. time-series analytics) of its captured data, and analytic tools of other products (e.g. VAS) that may support sensor planning. 

### Planning
Users can leverage the shared planning workspace on SAM+, which allows inter-agency collaboration in sensor planning. They can view current sensors deployed in their area of interest by using a drawing tool on SAM+ to plan their sensors in optimal locations. Agencies can, for example, upload and layer their own confidential data into SAM+ map layers for viewing.

### Workflows
Automated workflow engines will allow sensor planners to replace manual processes in obtaining endorsements and approvals for sensor registration and planning purposes.
