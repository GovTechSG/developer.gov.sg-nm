The pre-requisites for onboarding CVX will vary depending on the specific system that your agency is running.

The prequisites for your agency may include the following:

- A network of cameras that are connected to a camera system
- The agency system needs to support outbound internet connections to connect to CVX
- In some cases, a bespoke software connector would have to be created between the agency system and CVX first, during the technical integration process

The CVX team will have to evaluate each onboarding request in detail with each agency.
