CVX is designed to help agencies with two categories of use cases, namely, linking different camera systems within an agency, and facilitating cross-agency use cases across different agencies.

### Linking different camera systems within an agency

**How CVX can Help:**

- CVX can “plug in” seamlessly to each of your agency’s different video or camera systems (VMS/ NVR), without significant infrastructure changes or harmonisation impacting your systems
- After which, CVX can enable your agency users to view live streams, historical streams, or download videos to their own computers, regardless of the source video or camera systems
- CVX can provide usage reports across your video systems, allowing agencies to track which user accessed different videos at different points in time.
- Agencies can setup and share common pre-sets, which comprises of multiple pre-defined camera views from multiple systems – which are critical for common monitoring of important events

### Facilitating cross-agency use cases

**How CVX can Help:**

- If your agency is a contributing agency, CVX can enable your agency to share video feeds with another agency, through an [Instruction Manual for ICT&SS Management](/guidelines/standards-and-best-practices/instruction-manual-for-ict-ss-management.html){:target="_blank"} (previously known as IM8)-compliant platform, while still retaining the ability to manage permissions and camera controls
- If your agency is a receiving agency, CVX can enable your agency to receive video feeds from a contributing agency, through a web-platform – with no integration required
- CVX enables multi-agency monitoring of a large-scale event from various control centres, without the need for hefty physical on-site infrastructure setup.
- CVX also facilitates multi-agency investigations across multiple cameras, owned by different agencies, at different locations
