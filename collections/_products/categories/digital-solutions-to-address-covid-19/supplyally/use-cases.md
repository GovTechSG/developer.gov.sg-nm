### Distributing COVID-19 test kits using SupplyAlly

1. The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) contacted the GovTech SupplyAlly team in Aug 2021, as they wanted to distribute free COVID-19 test kits to foreign workers who resided in the dormitories.

2. The SupplyAlly team quickly reached out to MOM and worked out the collaboration details. The MOM team provided key information such as the objective and logistical details of of the distribution exercise, the intended recipients, and the maxiumum number of test kits each recipient could receive.

3. The SupplyAlly team carefully evaluated the request. Factors taken into consideration included the urgency and criticality of the distribution exercise, and the potential technical complexities involved – such as the amount of customisation required.

3. Once the deployment of SupplyAlly was confirmed, MOM then organised the distribution locations, while the SupplyAlly team set up the backend system and trained the core team at MOM on the usage of the SupplyAlly app.

4. The distribution of COVID-19 test kits started in Sep 2022, and subsequently restarted in Feb 2023, at up to 1,500 distribution locations.
