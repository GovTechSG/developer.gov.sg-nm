[Isomer](https://www.isomer.gov.sg/){:target="\_blank"} is an informational website generator created by GovTech's Open Government Products team. It is an easy-to-deploy static website building and hosting service designed to help public officers create usable, secure, and faster informational websites within days.

It provides templates for websites with hosting and is compliant with applicable clauses in the [Instruction Manual for Infocomm Technology and Smart Systems (ICT&SS) Management](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/guidelines/standards-and-best-practices/instruction-manual-for-ict-ss-management.html){:target="\_blank"} (previously known as previously known as IM8), the [Digital Service Standards (DSS)](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/guidelines/standards-and-best-practices/digital-service-standards.html){:target="\_blank"} and the Usability Checklist (UC).

GovTech built and maintains Isomer as a service to all Singapore Government Agencies and Healthcare Institutions. The free service covers website hosting, maintenance, and support for the system. 

As Isomer sites are static sites, there are no databases to hack and no vulnerabilities like SQL injections or XSS.

GovTech creates and manages the design for all Isomer sites and ensures they remain accessible, secure, and fast. This model works very well for sites that are informational in nature, such as small corporate or initiative sites, that need to launch quickly.

The Isomer team is now working on enhancing Isomer’s Security to verify the legitimacy of users, and keeping the end-to-end experience within the CMS by moving users off GitHub. Upcoming plans include exploring new templates for various use cases and Block Editing to improve the user experience in editing the CMS. In the future, the Isomer team will be bridging the gaps to cater to larger, more complex sites.
